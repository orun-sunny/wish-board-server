Task Detail:

1. Home page here i have a header (simple navbar), banner, products, reviews, and footer. On the home page, the products will have 6 packages. You can put one or more products in a row based on your design. If a user clicks on the buy now button it will take the user to the purchase page.

2.The buy now page is private/protected route. Please make sure that if the user is not logged in, the private route redirects to the login page. After login, the user will be redirected to the page he/she wanted to go to. Also, here i make sure, after reloading the page of a private route, the user is not redirected to the login page. The purchase page should display detailed information of the item the user has clicked somewhere at the top. It will also display the user's name and email address from the login system and the user will have a field to provide address, phone number and necessary information to place the order or to complete the purchase.

3.here i Implemented email/ password (login/Register) based login system. The registration form should have the name and once a user is logged in, the user name, and the logout button here will appear on the header which will log out the user once clicked.
4.If a user is logged in, he/she will see another option on the header is called Dashboard and inside that dashboard a normal user (not an admin) will see options like pay,My Orders, Review, Logout.
5.On the my orders page, the logged in user will see only his orders. If the user wants, he should be able to cancel/delete any order

6.On the Review page, users should be able to add a review and that review will appear on the home age. Right now you will see every review on the home page. There is no limit on the numbers of reviews or the order of the review.
7.If an admin logs in, he/she will not see the options that a normal user sees. Insted an admin will see Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, Manage Products Logout.

8. Here i used mongodb as a database.
